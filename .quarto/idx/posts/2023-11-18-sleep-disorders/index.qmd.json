Across the diagonal, we see the distributions of scores. None of the variables have a normal distribution, exhibiting various degrees of modality.\n\nIf we look only at the predictors, then the highest correlation is between sleep duration and stress level which is significant at the 0.0001 level (*r* = -0.81). Focussing on the outcome variable, of all of the predictors, stress level and sleep duration correlate best with the outcome (*r*s = -0.9 and 0.88 respectively).\n\n### One predictor model\n\n```{r}\nqs_lm_01 <- lm(data=sleep, formula = quality_of_sleep ~ stress_level)\n\n# checking model fit\nglance(qs_lm_01) %>% gt() %>%\nopt_stylize(style=6, color=\"blue\") %>% fmt_number(decimals=3)\n```\n\nStress level accounts for 80.8% of the variation in quality of sleep.\n\nTherefore, we can say that adding the predictor of **stress_level** significantly improved the fit of the model to the data compared to having no predictors in the model, *F*(1, 372) = 1563.03, *p* \\< .001\n\n#### Model parameters\n\n```{r}\ntidy(qs_lm_01, conf.int = T) %>% gt() %>%\nopt_stylize(style=6, color=\"blue\") %>% fmt_number(decimals=3)\n\n```\n\nIf stress level increases by 1 point, quality_of_sleep reduces by more than half a point. This estimate is significant (p \\< 0.0000001). With the chance of being wrong 5% of the time, our estimate is going to be somewhere in the range \\[-0.636, -0.576\\]. This confidence interval does not cross zero, so we can be sure that a real effect exists.\n\n```{r}\n# summary of the model parameters and fit\nsummary(qs_lm_01)\n```\n\n### Multiple predictors\n\n```{r}\nqs_lm_02 <- lm(quality_of_sleep ~ stress_level+sleep_duration+age+physical_activity_level, data=sleep)\n# fit statistics\nglance(qs_lm_02) %>% gt() %>%\nopt_stylize(style=6, color=\"blue\") %>% fmt_number(decimals=3)\n```\n\nThe % of variance explained by the predictors increased to 89% from our previous value of 81%.\n\nIn other words, sleep duration, age and physical activity level account for an additional 89% - 80.8% = 8.2% of the variance in quality of sleep. The difference between the $R^2$ and the adjusted $R^2$ is 0.8921-0.8909= 0.0012. Which means if the model were derived from the population rather than a sample we'd conclude that it accounted for approximately 0.12% less variance in the outcome.\n\n#### Model parameter estimates\n\n```{r}\ntidy(qs_lm_02, conf.int=T) %>% gt() %>%\nopt_stylize(style=6, color=\"blue\") %>% fmt_number(decimals=3)\n```\n\n::: callout-tip\n-   Stress level : For every unit increase in stress level, quality of sleep reduces by 0.35 points.

Time to use robust methods!\n\n#### Robust parameter estimates\n\nNow we check for the significance of the test of bias and we compare their corresponding coefficients.\n\n```{r}\nqs_lm_rob <- lmRob(quality_of_sleep ~ stress_level+sleep_duration+age+physical_activity_level, data = sleep, na.action = na.exclude)\nsummary(qs_lm_rob)\n```\n\n```{r}\nqs_lm_rob <- lmRob(quality_of_sleep ~ stress_level+sleep_duration+age+physical_activity_level, data = sleep, na.action = na.exclude)\nqs_lm_rob %>% tidy(conf.int=TRUE)\n```\n\n```{r}\nsummary(qs_lm_02)\n```\n\nThere is reason to believe that our original model, qs_lm_02, is biased.

Conclusion\n\nSleep disorder is not a moderator of the relationship between sleep duration and quality of sleep\n\n### Is the relationship between stress level and quality of sleep moderated by occupation?\n\n```{r}\nqs_lm_04 <- lm(quality_of_sleep ~ stress_level * occupation, data=sleep)\nqs_lm_04 %>% tidy() %>% gt() %>%\nopt_stylize(style=6,

do not observe a significant moderation effect of occupation on the relationship between stress level and quality of sleep\n\n### Is the relationship between physical activity and quality of sleep mediated by daily steps?\n\nTo test this, we are going to run 3 regressions:\n\n-   The **total effect** of *`physical_activity_level`* on *`quality_of_sleep`.*\n\n-   The effect of *`physical_activity_level`* on *`quality_of_sleep`* that is mediated by *`daily_steps`*, a.k.a. the **indirect effect**\n\n-   The effect of *`physical_activity_level`* on *`quality_of_sleep`* that is not mediated by *`daily_steps`*, a.k.a. the **direct effect**\n\n#### Total effect\n\nWe first determine the total effect by running a regression of *physical_activity_level* on *quality_of_sleep* (without including *daily_steps*):\n\n```{r}\nlm(quality_of_sleep ~ physical_activity_level, sleep) %>% tidy() %>% gt() %>%\nopt_stylize(style=6, color=\"blue\") %>% fmt_number(decimals=3)\n```\n\nThe total effect is approximately 0.011, meaning that an increase of one unit in physical activity increases sleep quality by 0.001 units on average, not holding daily steps constant.\n\n#### Mediated/Indirect Effect\n\nThe effect of *`physical_activity_level`* on *`quality_of_sleep`* mediated by *`daily_steps`* can be obtained by multiplying together the effect of *`physical_activity_level`* on *`daily_steps`* and the effect of *`daily_steps`* on *`quality_of_sleep`*.\n\n##### *1. physical_activity_level* on *daily_steps (a)*\n\n```{r}\nlm(daily_steps ~ physical_activity_level, sleep) %>% tidy() %>% gt() %>%\nopt_stylize(style=6, color=\"blue\")\n```\n\nOne unit increase in *physical_activity_level* increases *daily_steps* by an average of 60 steps\n\n##### *2. daily_steps* on *quality_of_sleep*\n\n```{r}\nlm(quality_of_sleep ~ daily_steps + physical_activity_level, sleep) %>% tidy() %>% gt() %>%\nopt_stylize(style=6, color=\"blue\")\n```\n\n(a \\* b) = 60.07 \\* -0.00024 = -0.0144\n\n#### Direct Effect\n\nThis is simply the coefficient of physical_activity_level in the above regression = 0.0257\n\nAccording to Zhao *et al.,* what we have here isCompetitive Mediation (Regularly Partial Mediation)\n\nIn the competitive partial mediation hypothesis, it is assumed that the intermediate variable (*daily_steps*) could sometimes increase and at times decrease the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. i.e an \"inconsistent\" model.\n\n![Decision tree for determining mediation](images/Zhao%20et%20al.PNG){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n# Difference in means\n\n## Research question: are significant differences in the mean sleep quality of both male and female participants\n\n```{r}\n# summary statistics of quality_of_sleep by gender\n\nby(cbind(data=sleep$quality_of_sleep), sleep$gender, psych::describe)\n```\n\nThe mean of female participants is one point higher than males. But is this difference significant?\n\n```{r}\n# plotting a violin-errorbar plot to visualise the relationship\nggplot(sleep, aes(gender,quality_of_sleep))+\ngeom_violin() +\nstat_summary(fun.data=\"mean_cl_normal\") + \ntheme_minimal()\n```\n\nSince the errorbars do not overlap, we can be fairly confident that the difference is significant. Lets confirm this hunch with a Welsh's t-test.\n\n```{r}\n t.test(quality_of_sleep ~ gender,\n                    data = sleep,\n                    paired = FALSE,\n                    var.equal = FALSE,\n                    conf.level = 0.95,\n                    na.action = na.exclude)\n\n```\n\nBecause the *p*-value = 1.078e-08 is less than our alpha of .05, we can conclude that the difference between both genders is significant. Also, since the confidence interval expressing the true difference in means does not cross zero, we can be confident that there exists a true difference, with a chance of us being wrong 5% of the time.\n\n```{r}\neffectsize::cohens_d(quality_of_sleep ~ gender, data = sleep) %>% gt() %>%\nopt_stylize(style=6, color=\"blue\") %>% fmt_number(decimals=3)\n```\n\n::: callout-tip\nOn average, female participants have better sleep quality (*M* = 7.66, *SE* = 0.09), than those not given a cloak (*M* = 6.97, *SE* = 0.07). Sleep quality is significantly different for both genders: the mean difference, *M* = 0.69, 95% CI \\[0.46, 0.93\\], was significantly different from 0, *t*(347.96) = 5.85, *p* = 01.078e-08.

Those with few counts can be consolidated with similar categories.\n\n-   The BMI category variable has both \"Normal\" and \"Normal Weight\" as levels. This is most likely as data entry error.\n\n-   The heart rate variable is not in a suitable format to work with. I'll extract the systolic blood pressure from the variable as an integer. I would not need the diastolic blood pressure as I observed strong multicollinearity between both diastolic and systolic blood pressure.\n\n```{r}\n# observe occupations with low frequency counts\nggplot(sleep, aes(occupation))+geom_bar(fill=\"#25d366\", color=\"black\") + coord_flip()\n```\n\n```{r}\n# observe data entry error in bmi_category variable\nggplot(sleep, aes(bmi_category))+geom_bar(fill=\"#25d366\", color=\"black\") + coord_flip()\n```\n\n```{r}\n# regrouping occupation variable so that occupations with lower counts are consolidated with other similar occupations.

Across the diagonal, we see the distributions of scores. None of the variables have a normal distribution, exhibiting various degrees of modality.\n\nIf we look only at the predictors, then the highest correlation is between sleep duration and stress level which is significant at the 0.0001 level (*r* = -0.81). Focussing on the outcome variable, of all of the predictors, stress level and sleep duration correlate best with the outcome (*r*s = -0.9 and 0.88 respectively).\n\n### One predictor model\n\n```{r}\nqs_lm_01 <- lm(data=sleep, formula = quality_of_sleep ~ stress_level)\n\n# checking model fit\nglance(qs_lm_01) %>% gt() %>%\nopt_stylize(style=6, color=\"blue\") %>% fmt_number(decimals=3)\n```\n\nStress level accounts for 80.8% of the variation in quality of sleep.\n\nTherefore, we can say that adding the predictor of **stress_level** significantly improved the fit of the model to the data compared to having no predictors in the model, *F*(1, 372) = 1563.03, *p* \\< .001\n\n#### Model parameters\n\n```{r}\ntidy(qs_lm_01, conf.int = T) %>% gt() %>%\nopt_stylize(style=6, color=\"blue\") %>% fmt_number(decimals=3)\n\n```\n\nIf stress level increases by 1 point, quality_of_sleep reduces by more than half a point. This estimate is significant (p \\< 0.0000001). With the chance of being wrong 5% of the time, our estimate is going to be somewhere in the range \\[-0.636, -0.576\\]. This confidence interval does not cross zero, so we can be sure that a real effect exists.\n\n```{r}\n# summary of the model parameters and fit\nsummary(qs_lm_01)\n```\n\n### Multiple predictors\n\n```{r}\nqs_lm_02 <- lm(quality_of_sleep ~ stress_level+sleep_duration+age+physical_activity_level, data=sleep)\n# fit statistics\nglance(qs_lm_02) %>% gt() %>%\nopt_stylize(style=6, color=\"blue\") %>% fmt_number(decimals=3)\n```\n\nThe % of variance explained by the predictors increased to 89% from our previous value of 81%.\n\nIn other words, sleep duration, age and physical activity level account for an additional 89% - 80.8% = 8.2% of the variance in quality of sleep. The difference between the $R^2$ and the adjusted $R^2$ is 0.8921-0.8909= 0.0012. Which means if the model were derived from the population rather than a sample we'd conclude that it accounted for approximately 0.12% less variance in the outcome.\n\n#### Model parameter estimates\n\n```{r}\ntidy(qs_lm_02, conf.int=T) %>% gt() %>%\nopt_stylize(style=6, color=\"blue\") %>% fmt_number(decimals=3)\n```\n\n::: callout-tip\n-   Stress level : For every unit increase in stress level, quality of sleep reduces by 0.35 points.

Conclusion\n\nSleep disorder is not a moderator of the relationship between sleep duration and quality of sleep\n\n### Is the relationship between stress level and quality of sleep moderated by occupation?\n\n```{r}\nqs_lm_04 <- lm(quality_of_sleep ~ stress_level * occupation, data=sleep)\nqs_lm_04 %>% tidy() %>% gt() %>%\nopt_stylize(style=6,

do not observe a significant moderation effect of occupation on the relationship between stress level and quality of sleep\n\n### Is the relationship between physical activity and quality of sleep mediated by daily steps?\n\nTo test this, we are going to run 3 regressions:\n\n-   The **total effect** of *`physical_activity_level`* on *`quality_of_sleep`.*\n\n-   The effect of *`physical_activity_level`* on *`quality_of_sleep`* that is mediated by *`daily_steps`*, a.k.a. the **indirect effect**\n\n-   The effect of *`physical_activity_level`* on *`quality_of_sleep`* that is not mediated by *`daily_steps`*, a.k.a. the **direct effect**\n\n#### Total effect\n\nWe first determine the total effect by running a regression of *physical_activity_level* on *quality_of_sleep* (without including *daily_steps*):\n\n```{r}\nlm(quality_of_sleep ~ physical_activity_level, sleep) %>% tidy() %>% gt() %>%\nopt_stylize(style=6, color=\"blue\") %>% fmt_number(decimals=3)\n```\n\nThe total effect is approximately 0.011, meaning that an increase of one unit in physical activity increases sleep quality by 0.001 units on average, not holding daily steps constant.\n\n#### Mediated/Indirect Effect\n\nThe effect of *`physical_activity_level`* on *`quality_of_sleep`* mediated by *`daily_steps`* can be obtained by multiplying together the effect of *`physical_activity_level`* on *`daily_steps`* and the effect of *`daily_steps`* on *`quality_of_sleep`*.\n\n##### *1. physical_activity_level* on *daily_steps (a)*\n\n```{r}\nlm(daily_steps ~ physical_activity_level, sleep) %>% tidy() %>% gt() %>%\nopt_stylize(style=6, color=\"blue\")\n```\n\nOne unit increase in *physical_activity_level* increases *daily_steps* by an average of 60 steps\n\n##### *2. daily_steps* on *quality_of_sleep*\n\n```{r}\nlm(quality_of_sleep ~ daily_steps + physical_activity_level, sleep) %>% tidy() %>% gt() %>%\nopt_stylize(style=6, color=\"blue\")\n```\n\n(a \\* b) = 60.07 \\* -0.00024 = -0.0144\n\n#### Direct Effect\n\nThis is simply the coefficient of physical_activity_level in the above regression = 0.0257\n\nAccording to Zhao *et al.,* what we have here isCompetitive Mediation (Regularly Partial Mediation)\n\nIn the competitive partial mediation hypothesis, it is assumed that the intermediate variable (*daily_steps*) could sometimes increase and at times decrease the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. i.e an \"inconsistent\" model.\n\n![Decision tree for determining mediation](images/Zhao%20et%20al.PNG){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n# Difference in means\n\n## Research question: are significant differences in the mean sleep quality of both male and female participants\n\n```{r}\n# summary statistics of quality_of_sleep by gender\n\nby(cbind(data=sleep$quality_of_sleep), sleep$gender, psych::describe)\n```\n\nThe mean of female participants is one point higher than males. But is this difference significant?\n\n```{r}\n# plotting a violin-errorbar plot to visualise the relationship\nggplot(sleep, aes(gender,quality_of_sleep))+\ngeom_violin() +\nstat_summary(fun.data=\"mean_cl_normal\") + \ntheme_minimal()\n```\n\nSince the errorbars do not overlap, we can be fairly confident that the difference is significant. Lets confirm this hunch with a Welsh's t-test.\n\n```{r}\n t.test(quality_of_sleep ~ gender,\n                    data = sleep,\n                    paired = FALSE,\n                    var.equal = FALSE,\n                    conf.level = 0.95,\n                    na.action = na.exclude)\n\n```\n\nBecause the *p*-value = 1.078e-08 is less than our alpha of .05, we can conclude that the difference between both genders is significant. Also, since the confidence interval expressing the true difference in means does not cross zero, we can be confident that there exists a true difference, with a chance of us being wrong 5% of the time.\n\n```{r}\neffectsize::cohens_d(quality_of_sleep ~ gender, data = sleep) %>% gt() %>%\nopt_stylize(style=6, color=\"blue\") %>% fmt_number(decimals=3)\n```\n\n::: callout-tip\nOn average, female participants have better sleep quality (*M* = 7.66, *SE* = 0.09), than those not given a cloak (*M* = 6.97, *SE* = 0.07).
