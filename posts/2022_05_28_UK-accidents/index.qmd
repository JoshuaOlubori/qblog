## Requirement Gathering

Client wants to create a dashboard on road accidents for the year 2021 and 2022.

#### a. Primary KPIs

-   Total Casualties and Total Accident Values:
    -   Current Year
    -   Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth
-   Total Casualties by Accident Severity:
    -   Current Year
    -   Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth

#### b. Secondary KPIs

-   Total Casualties with Respect to Vehicle Type:

    -   Current Year

-   Monthly Trend Comparison of Casualties:

    -   Current Year vs. Previous Year

-   Casualties by Road Type:

    -   Current Year

-   Current Year Casualties by Area/Location & Day/Night

-   Total Casualties and Total Accidents by Location Total casualties and total accidents by location

## Identifying Stakeholders üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíº

-   Emergency Services Departments
-   Road Safety Corps
-   Traffic Management Agencies
-   Police Force
-   General public

## Understanding Raw Data ü•©

## Data cleansing üßπ

Issues - Junction_Control column has, among others, two values "Auto traffic sigl" and "Auto traffic signal" of which the former is a misspelling of the latter

-   Instances where "Fatal" is misspelled as "Fetal" in Accident_Severity column

-   "Time" column was represented as a datetime data type in Power BI

Fixes - Used the Replace Values feature to correct the misspellings of Issues 1 & 2 - Changed the data type to time accordingly - All fixes were done in Power Query.

### Data Processing ‚öôÔ∏è

-   The data needs a calendar table so as to use Time Intelligence functions further down the line.

-   Using the CALENDAR function, a new table with calculated, dynamic columns of Date, Month and Year was generated.

### Data Modeling üèõ

a one-to-many active relationship was established between the calendar table and the data table ![Schema](data-model.png)

### Data Visualization üé®

-   Power BI magic!‚ú® The report pbix file is available in this repo to explore design decisions The following DAX measures were used:

```         
Count of Accidents = DISTINCTCOUNT(Data[Accident_Index])

Current Year Accident Count = TOTALYTD(COUNT(Data[Accident_Index]),'Calendar'[Date])

Current Year Casualties = TOTALYTD(SUM(Data[Number_of_Casualties]),'Calendar'[Date])

Previous Year Accident Counts = CALCULATE(COUNT(Data[Accident_Index]), SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Calendar'[Date]))

Previous Year Casualties = CALCULATE(SUM(Data[Number_of_Casualties]),
SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Calendar'[Date]))

YoY Accident Count = DIVIDE([Current Year Accident Count] - [Previous Year Accident Counts], [Previous Year Accident Counts])

YoY Casualties = (DIVIDE([Current Year Casualties] - [Previous Year Casualties],[Previous Year Casualties]))
```

### Deriving Insights

-   The vehicle type most involved in accidents was cars. This can be explained by the fact that most vehicles plying UK roads are cars

-   There is a general decrease in casualty counts in 2022 compared to 2021
