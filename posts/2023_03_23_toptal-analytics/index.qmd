### Overview
Assume that you are partnering with Toptal‚Äôs Growth team; a highly analytical,
experimental team that is responsible for growing Toptal‚Äôs revenue by scaling and
optimizing client acquisition channels. The growth team wants your help in measuring
and reporting on their business performance.

For this exercise, 2 datasets are provided. GrowthOperations.csv consists of all the leads
that Toptal‚Äôs Growth Team has obtained over the past 48 weeks. GrowthSpend.csv
shows how much the Growth Team has spent each week on each client acquisition
channel over the past 48 weeks.

### Tasks
1. Choose appropriate KPIs you recommend the Growth team use to measure their
performance.

2. Design a dashboard that the Growth team can use to regularly monitor performance
You can choose to use SQL, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or any data manipulation tool to analyze
the data. But you need to use Tableau to build the dashboard.
‚óã The purpose of the exercise is to choose and define meaningful KPIs and insights, to be presented in
an effective design, using Tableau as a tool.
‚óã Feel free to include any additional documents or sheets you create to analyze the data, in addition to
the Tableau file.

3. Prepare slide for a presentation on the following:
‚óè An Executive Summary on the Growth team performance
‚óã Include specific recommendations for improving performance. Why did you make these
recommendations?

‚óè A more detailed dive into Growth‚Äôs team performance over the past 48 weeks:
‚óã Identify and discuss the most problematic channel. Why is it the most problematic?
‚óã Are there major shifts in performance over time?
‚óã In what ways does lead priority predict the way in which leads will move through the funnel?
‚óè Definitions of the KPIs you have chosen and explain why you chose them
‚óè Screenshots of your dashboard design showing overall layout and functionality
‚óè A list of any assumptions you made and the justification of why you think they are reasonable


### Definitions
‚óè Lead: A company that has signed up on Toptal.com and is interested in learning more
about Toptal.
‚óè Verified: A company that has provided us their billing information after having a call
with a sales representative. Treat this as a strong indicator that they are going to
convert into a paying client. This is the primary metric that the Growth Team is
responsible for on a weekly basis.
‚óè Lead Priority: A priority assigned to each lead according to a machine learning
algorithm that indicates how likely the lead is to become a Verified, based on Toptal‚Äôs
historical data. Leads are treated differently by the sales team according to which
priority they are assigned.
‚óè Time Until Verification: The time from when a company signs up as a Lead until it
turns into a Verified.
‚óè Channel: The client acquisition channel through which this company found out about
Toptal (i.e. How they ended up on Toptal.com).
‚óè Display: Leads coming in from display advertising. For example, the Google Display
Network.
‚óè AdWords: Leads coming in from Google AdWords, a paid search channel.
‚óè Organic: Leads coming in from Google organic (unpaid) search results. Since this is
not an advertising channel, the weekly spend here is always $0.
‚óè LinkedIn: Leads coming in from the LinkedIn advertising platform.
