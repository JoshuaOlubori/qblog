## Requirement Gathering

In this case study, I'll be working with HealthStat, a fictitious consulting company, to uncover insights on potential hospital efficiency opportunities. The goal is to analyze a state-wide hospital dataset and create an engaging Power BI dashboard to visualize key insights, focusing on the efficiency domain, specifically minimizing waste and reducing length of stay (LOS).

By applying Power BI skills to real-world data, I'll explore how to leverage data analytics to improve hospital operations, reduce costs, and enhance patient care. The analysis will explore factors impacting LOS, such as patient age, health status, and procedure type, and create informative visuals to support data-driven business decisions for improving efficiency.

#### Primary KPIs

-   Total Discharge

-   Length of Stay

#### Features

-   Data model

## Data cleansing and Modeling üßπ

The raw data was delivered in a single csv file. I identified identify entities and used Power Query to isolate them as dimensions, deduplicating them and loading them as separate tables.
